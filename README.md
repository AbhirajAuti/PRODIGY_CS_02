Pixel manipulation for image encryption and decryption involves altering the pixel values of an image to secure its content. This technique is used in various cryptographic algorithms to transform an image into an unreadable format, making it inaccessible without the correct decryption key.

Here are the Encryption Process:

Pixel Value Transformation: The pixel values (which represent colors) are modified based on a specific algorithm, such as XOR operations, bit shuffling, or pixel permutation. This makes the image appear distorted and unrecognizable.

Key Usage: A cryptographic key is often used to control the manipulation process. The same key must be used during decryption to restore the original image.

Chaos-Based Encryption: Some methods use chaotic maps or random number generators to shuffle or change pixel positions or values in a complex, non-repetitive manner.
